# mario-platformer
2D Mario platformer written in Java

<b>Overview</b>

This is some code I wrote a years ago when I started programming. It was my introduction to game programming program. At the time I was pretty proud of the code, now I realize it is not any good. There are little hacks all over the place. Despite the messiness, it does run pretty well. By default the level loader loads a single level which you cannot complete. Death is not implemented, but a message is printed to console when you die. 

A small part of the code is adopted from the book "Developing Games in Java" by David Brackeen (which, btw, is an okay book, at best). There are a lot of good Mario resource files hidden within.

<b>Controls</b>

- Arrow keys to move
- Down to crouch
- Shift to run
- Space bar to jump
- Press 'Z' to pause the game, and press 'X' to resume. While paused you can press '1' to increment a single frame

<b>Project Environment</b>

Clone the repository and import into Eclipse.
